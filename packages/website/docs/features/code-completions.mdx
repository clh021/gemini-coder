# Code completions

This feature enables you inserting code completions directly at cursor's position while using the selected context. Code completions in Code Web Chat use big and capable models which have latency too high for automatic invocation on each keystroke but the results are of much greater quality.

_Structure of the generated API request:_

<Tabs groupId="fim-message-structure">
  <TabItem value="api" label="API">

```
<files>
  <file path="...">...</file> (Context files)
  ...
  <file path="...">
    ...
    <missing text>
    ...
  </file>
</files>
Somewhere in files you encountered the <missing text> symbol. Send the missing code only, without explanations, or any other text.
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="chat" label="CHAT">

Chat instruction asks for reasoning behind the decision about completion.

```
<files>
  <file path="...">...</file> (Context files)
  ...
  <file path="...">
    ...
    <missing text>
    ...
  </file>
</files>
Somewhere in files you encountered the <missing text> symbol. Send the missing code and explain your reasoning.
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
