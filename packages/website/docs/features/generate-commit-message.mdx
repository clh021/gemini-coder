# Generate Commit Message

<files>
  <file path="...">...</file> (Affected files)
  ...
</files>
[COMMIT MESSAGE PROMPT] (Write a brief and precise summary for the following diff, limited to a single sentence if possible. Use an imperative tone to ensure clarity and focus on the primary change or purpose.)
[DIFF OF CHANGES]
```
