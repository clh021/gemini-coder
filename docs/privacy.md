# Privacy

Code Web Chat does not collect any usage data

## Core principles

### No tracking

Code Web Chat does not collect any usage statistics.

### API communication

All your requests are sent directly to the model provider, e.g. Gemini API.

### Web browser communication

A local WebSocket server is used for bi-directional message passing.

### Open source

Code Web Chat is open source under the MIT license. This means the entire codebase is publicly available for review and audit. You can verify for yourself that the extension operates as described and adheres to these privacy principles.
