# Tips

Here are some tips and best practices for using Code Web Chat effectively.

## Context

- Avoid context pollution, for the best performance keep it around 20k tokens.
- Use saved contexts when you often switch between features in a monorepo.
- Include files that demonstrate your team's coding conventions.
- Monitor the token count to stay within reasonable context lengths (~15k).

## Chat

- Compare responses across different AI platforms for challenging problems.
- Create task-specific presets (debugging, refactoring, explaining).

## Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM)

- Learn when smaller, faster models are sufficient and when you need to resort to priecier, slower ones.
- Bind the FIM completion command to a keyboard shortcut for faster access.
- Use inline documentation comments above cursor.

## Refactoring and applying changes

- Review the applied changes before commiting.
