Context is something you constantly adjust as you code. CWC makes it simple by using the file explorer you already know.

**Selected items are structured with XML:**

```
<files>
  <text title="...">...</text> // selected websites
  ...
  <file path="...">...</file> // selected workspace files
  ...
</files>
```

**Context is attached with:**

- web chats
- context edit and code completions API tools
